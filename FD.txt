potential keys: (ssn, code, classificationName), (login, code, classificationName)
Both ssn and login is unique values of a student.
A student can have only one relation to a course.
code is the only unique value of the course.
a course can have zero or more classifications.
Thus the only keys are a tuple of code, classificationName and ssn or login.
BCNF violations: every dependency above except the keys
