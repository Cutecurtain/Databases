super keys: (ssn, code, classificationName), (login, code, classificationName)

Both ssn and login is unique values of a student.
Code is the only unique value of a course.
A student can only have one relationship to a course (registered, taken, waiting list).
Thus the only superkey are: (code, ssn or login).

Now we choose to use the student ssn as primary key for the student. And just keep login unique.
We also choose that programs and courses that is part of a department only reference the department name instead of the abreviation.

Identify all relations that doesn't violate BCNF, that is relations that are either trivial or superkeys:

Functional dependencies:
															BCNF:
															
programDepartmentName		-> programDepartmentAbr									Trivial
programDepartmentAbr		-> programDepartmentName								Trivial

programName			-> (programAbr,programDepartmentName,mandatoryProgram)					

ssn				-> (studentName,login,programName,branchName)						

courseDepartmentName		-> courseDepartmentAbr									Trivial
courseDepartmentAbr		-> courseDepartmentName									Trivial

courseCode			-> (courseName,credits,seats,prerequisite,classificationName,courseDepartmentName)	

(branchName,programName)	-> (mandatoryBranch,recommendedBranch)							

(ssn,courseCode)		-> "Everything"										Superkey
